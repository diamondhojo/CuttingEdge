- validate email button (actually works)
- add data field to Client model that allows us to track "Do Not Service" clients
- change date_updated to last_updated

Bugs:
- after creating database on startup, 'Jordan' is registered as a client. Add a new client and delete 'Jordan' and you get signed out and can't sign back in
- address only shows first half when editing employee/client
